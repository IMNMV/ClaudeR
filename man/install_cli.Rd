\usage{
install_cli(tools = "claude", python_path = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{tools}{A character vector specifying which CLI tools to configure.
Can be `"claude"`, `"gemini"`, or `c("claude", "gemini")`.}

\item{python_path}{Optional. A character string specifying the absolute path
to the Python executable to use. If `NULL` (the default), the script will

\description{
An installer that configures ClaudeR to be used with command-line
  AI tools like the Claude Code CLI and Google Gemini CLI.

  It follows a simple, non-interactive setup process. It will attempt to
  find a system Python automatically, or you can provide a specific path for
  custom environments (like Conda).
}
\details{
This function will:
  1. Check for and install required R packages.
  2. Attempt to install required Python packages (`mcp`, `httpx`) using the
     specified or found Python executable.
  3. Provide you with the exact command to run (for Claude) or the exact
     JSON to copy (for Gemini) to complete the setup.
